##### INTRO 
Spiney Lobster (Panulirus interruptus) are a species of special interest in California because they are a key predator in giant kelp forests. Kelp forests provide an abundance of food and coastline protection to shoreline communities. In 2012, 2 Marine protected areas (MPAs) were established in Santa Barbara County at Naples and Isla Vista. The Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Team began collecting samples at five different kelp forest research sites. Two of these sites are within marine protected areas (Naples and Isla Vista) and three are outside of the marine protected area zones (Arroyo Quemodo, Mohawk, and Carpinteria). In this report, we explore data from the SBC LTR team to analyze lobster population trends, abundance and size in the MPA sites and non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018.

##### DATA AND METHODS (VANESSA)

The dataset includes abundance (count) and carapace size (mm) data of spiney lobstar in 5 designated sites: 2 MPAs (Naples and Isla Vista) and 3 non-MPAs (Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk and Carpinteria) from 2012 through 2018. The data is collected annually by divers from October to March before the start of the lobster season. During that time, data is collected every 2-4 weeks. Our methods for observing and analyzing the data included visualually exploraing the data and the following statistical tests: two-sided T-tests, mean, SD, sample size, p-value, confidence intervals, QQ plot. Specifically, we used these tests to infer distributions and differences across these key variables: size, count, years and sites. 


###### RESULTS A: Abundance of lobsters per site

###### RESULTS B: Lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 & 2018

```{r, include = FALSE}

# RESULTS B
# Q: Is there a significanct difference in lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018.
# Data sets for lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018, together and separately

lobster_12_18 <- lobster_tidy %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) # 2036 observations 

lobster_12 <- lobster_tidy %>% # 231 observations 
  filter(year == "2012")

lobster_18 <- lobster_tidy %>% # 1805 observations 
  filter(year == "2018")

# Based on Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of means in 2018 will be normally distributed because there are 1805 observations. There are 231 observations in the 2012 data, and because of the Central Limit Theorem, we can also assume normally distributed means, regardless of underlying population. Therefore, comparing means using a t-test is OK and we believe the means are a useful metric of comparison. CLT = sampling distribution of the means will be normal.
