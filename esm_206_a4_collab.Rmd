##### INTRODUCTION
Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus) are a species of special interest in California because they are a key predator in giant kelp forests. Kelp forests provide an abundance of food and coastline protection to shoreline communities. In 2012, two marine protected areas (MPAs) were established in Santa Barbara County at Naples and Isla Vista. The Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Team (SBC LTER) began collecting samples at five different kelp forest research sites. Two of these sites are within MPAs (Naples and Isla Vista) and three are outside of the MPA zones (Arroyo Quemodo, Mohawk, and Carpinteria). In this report, we explore data from the SBC LTR team to analyze changes in lobster population trends, abundance, and size at MPA sites versus non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018.

##### DATA AND METHODS

The dataset includes abundance (count) and carapace size (mm) data of spiny lobster in the 5 designated sites in Santa Barbara County between 2012 and 2018. The data is collected annually by divers from October to March before the start of the lobster season. During that time, data is collected every 2-4 weeks. Our methods for observing and analyzing the data include visually exploring the data and conducting the following statistical tests: two-sided T-tests ($\alpha$ = 0.05 throughout), mean, standard deviation, sample size, confidence intervals, p-value, and effect size. Specifically, we used these tests to infer distributions and differences across these key variables: size, count, years and sites. Analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1.

**Figure 3.** *Abundance of spiny lobsters at 5 different SBC LTER sites between the years 2012 and 2018. Counts for lobster abundance increased for Isla Vista and Naples (both MPA sites), while Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, and Mohawk (non-MPA sites) have varying declines of count from 2012 to 2018. Data: Reed D. 2019.*

##### RESULTS B: Lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018

```{r, include = FALSE}

# RESULTS B
# Q: Is there a significanct difference in lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018.
# Data sets for lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018, together and separately

lobster_12_18 <- lobster_tidy %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) # 2036 observations 

lobster_12 <- lobster_tidy %>% # 231 observations 
  filter(year == "2012")

lobster_18 <- lobster_tidy %>% # 1805 observations 
  filter(year == "2018")

# Based on Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of means in 2018 will be normally distributed because there are 1805 observations. There are 231 observations in the 2012 data, and because of the Central Limit Theorem, we can also assume normally distributed means, regardless of underlying population. Therefore, comparing means using a t-test is OK and we believe the means are a useful metric of comparison. CLT = sampling distribution of the means will be normal.

**Figure 4.** *Lobster carapace size (mm) distribution shifts between 2012 and 2018 increased significantly for both the MPA sites (IVEE and NAPL).

##### SUMMARY 
- Lobster abundance has significantly improved since the establishment of designated MPA sites (Figure 3). 
- Mean lobster size distribution has significantly increased at MPA sites from 2012 to 2018 (Figure 5), while at non-MPA sites a decrease of mean size can be observed (Table 1).
- We can infer from the tests used to analyze this data, that designated MPA sites increase the carapace size and abundance of spiny lobster populations more than non-MPA sites. Thus, indicating that marine protected areas allow for growth and increaed reproduction over non-protected areas.
